# NoCode Vote FHE: A No-Code Tool for Privacy-First Voting Solutions

NoCode Vote FHE is a powerful no-code tool that allows DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and communities to effortlessly create and deploy privacy-preserving voting systems using **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. This innovative platform offers a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, enabling any organization—regardless of technical expertise—to build customized voting contracts with FHE encryption features seamlessly integrated into their systems.

## The Challenge: Empowering Communities with Privacy

In today's digital age, the need for secure and private voting mechanisms has become paramount. Many communities struggle with implementing effective voting solutions that preserve voter privacy and ensure integrity, largely due to the technical barriers associated with traditional blockchain voting systems. These challenges can lead to increased distrust among members, reduced participation, and ultimately, a failure of the democratic process within DAOs.

## The FHE Solution: Privacy Reimagined

NoCode Vote FHE addresses these concerns by utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries**, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, to implement Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). FHE enables computations on encrypted data, allowing organizations to perform voting operations without exposing sensitive information. This ensures that votes remain confidential while still being verifiable, fostering trust and participation. Our platform simplifies the process, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their programming knowledge.

## Core Functionalities: Empowering Creators

- **Visual Voting Rules Editor**: Craft and customize voting rules using an intuitive interface.
- **Diverse FHE Voting Templates**: Choose from a variety of pre-built templates tailored for different voting scenarios.
- **One-Click Deployment**: Easily deploy your voting contracts to major blockchains with a single action.
- **Reduced Barriers to Adoption**: Enables DAOs to adopt privacy governance seamlessly, enhancing community engagement and trust.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: Leverages Zama’s cutting-edge FHE libraries for secure computations.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment facilitating server-side scripting.
- **Hardhat or Foundry**: Development environments for compiling and deploying smart contracts.
- **React**: Front-end library for building interactive user interfaces.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the NoCode Vote FHE project on your local development environment, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the project**: Ensure you have the project files available locally (make sure to avoid using `git clone`).
2. **Install Node.js and Hardhat/Foundry**: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js and either Hardhat or Foundry.
3. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use your terminal or command prompt to go to the NoCode Vote FHE directory.
4. **Install dependencies**: Run the following command to fetch the necessary Zama FHE libraries and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building and Running the Project

Once the installation is complete, you can build and run the project with the following commands:

1. **Compile the contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Run tests** to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. **Deploy the voting contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
   ```

Replace `<network-name>` with your chosen blockchain network.

## Example Usage

Here's a basic example of how you can create and deploy a voting contract using the NoCode Vote FHE platform:

```javascript
import { VotingContract } from './contracts/NoCode_Vote_Fhe.sol';

async function createVote() {
    const votingData = {
        title: "Community Governance Vote",
        options: ["Option A", "Option B"],
        rules: {
            maxVotes: 1,
            duration: "7 days"
        }
    };
    
    const contract = new VotingContract();
    await contract.deploy(votingData);
    console.log("Voting contract deployed successfully!");
}

createVote();
```

This simple script demonstrates how easy it is to deploy a voting contract with privacy features enabled.
